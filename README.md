# ESP32-infos

This project is an Arduino application designed for ESP32 microcontrollers. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for accessing various system and device information, such as IP address, MAC address, system time, memory details, ESP32 device specifics, available bus interfaces, and more.

# Key Features:

- Display of the device's IP address and MAC address.  
- Real-time display of system time.  
- Display of available memory information.  
- Display of ESP32 device details, including board model and chip type.  
- Display of available bus interfaces such as SPI, I2C, Ethernet, etc.  
- User-friendly interface with interactive buttons for navigating between features.  

# Usage:

1. Download the source code and open it in the Arduino IDE.  
2. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.  
3. Select the appropriate board type and serial port in the Arduino IDE.  
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.  
5. Open the serial monitor to display debug messages and interact with the application.  

This project serves as a demonstration of using ESP32 with the Arduino IDE and LVGL library to create interactive graphical user interfaces. You are encouraged to use, modify, and enhance it according to your needs.
